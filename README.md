Gan Aided Image Reconstruction

This project is part of my research under the Computational Sensing and Information Processing Lab at the University of California, Riverside.
Here I explore how a pre-trained Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) can be used to aid in Compressed Sensing and Image Reconstruction problems. The 
end goal is to try and incorporate this into a method that quickly reconstructs video frames.
